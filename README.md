1 Introduction
In our daily life people face many problems related to finding their lost valuables.
The application is intended for the person who has lost his valuables and the one who has
found those valuables. Both just have to visit the app and just have to make a profile. The
profile will consist of different required fields such as name, address, location, contact
number and email id and these profiles will be visible to all the visitors of portal. On
other hand everybody can see the ads of lost goods of users & can easily contact them
through the contact number and email provided by users.
The main idea of our project is to provide service to people who are struggling
with finding their lost valuables problems by building android based application. In this
project, we are willing to make a system based on the concept of user and second user.
User do effort to return someone’s valuable and he can also make some money if there is
reward included in the deal. In this system there will be one person will be doing efforts
like an employee and he will be called valuable returner and the other person will use
his service to get his valuables back and that person will be named as user. Only a single
android application interfaces will be used for both parties just. A database will be used
to save communication history between both parties for security purpose.
This deliverable is all about planning and scheduling of our project. So it contains the

19
Lost2find's USP lies in its commitment to connecting individuals,
fostering trust, and providing a simple, secure, and community-driven platform
for finding lost valuables.
7. Future Enhancements
As the Lost2find community grows, we envision incorporating features like real-
time chat, advanced search options, and expanded geographical coverage.
1.7.1 Problem Statement:
1. Inefficient Traditional Methods:
Current approaches for recovering lost items, such as physical posters or
word-of-mouth inquiries, are inefficient and lack a wide-reaching scope.
2. Lack of a Centralized Platform:
There is no centralized platform that effectively connects individuals who
have lost their valuables with those who have found them.
3. Privacy and Trust Concerns:
Users may be hesitant to share personal information or details about their
lost items on public platforms due to privacy and trust concerns.
4. Limited Communication Channels:
The absence of dedicated communication channels between the person
who lost the item and the finder makes the recovery process cumbersome.
5. Inadequate Tracking:
Traditional methods offer limited means of tracking the status of the lost
item or the efforts made for its return.
1.7.2 Successful Solutions:
1. User-Friendly Mobile Application and Web Portal:
 Develop an intuitive and easy-to-use mobile application and web portal
that caters to users of all technical backgrounds. A well-designed interface
ensures that users can efficiently post information about their lost
valuables and search for found items.
2. Centralized Lost-and-Found Platform:
 Create a centralized platform that connects individuals who have lost their
valuables with those who have found them. This platform allows users to
report lost items and search for found ones, consolidating all related
activities in one place.
3. Privacy and Data Security Measures:
 Implement robust data security measures to address privacy concerns.
Ensure that user data is securely handled, and obtain any necessary
certifications to instill trust in the platform.
4. Efficient Communication Channels:
 Enhance communication channels within the application to facilitate
interaction between those who have lost items and those who have found
them. Provide secure messaging and calling features to enable users to
connect and arrange item returns.

5. Advanced Tracking Capabilities:
 Improve item tracking features to keep users informed about their lost
items' status. Users should receive real-time updates, such as when their
item was last seen or if there have been retrieval attempts.
1.7.3 Positioning Statement:
Unlike other lost-and-find solutions, Lost2Find offers a user-friendly interface,
advanced tracking capabilities, and robust data security, providing a one-stop hub for
users to report their losses and recover their items efficiently. Our commitment to user
trust and efficient communication channels sets us apart, making Lost2Find the go-to
solution for reuniting people with their cherished belongings."
1.7.4 User Environment:
Lost2Find offers a user environment that caters to “valuable losers” seeking to
recover lost items, "valuable finders" who have discovered misplaced belongings and
wish to return them, "General Users" interested in assisting or staying informed, and an
"Admin and Support Team" responsible for platform management and user assistance.

1 Introduction
1.1 Systems Specifications
The following are the clauses that must be included while describing the system
specifications.
Introduction
Due to its platform being simple to use and affordable digital devices for
immediate cell phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and now even the smart televisions and
other computing devices, apps have grown to be the most often used application
software. In this project, we are willing to make a system based on the concept of User
and Employee and User and User. User do effort to return someone’s valuable and he can
also make some money if there is reward included in the deal. In this system there will be
one person will be doing efforts like an employee and he will be called Valuable Returner
and the other person will use his service to get his valuables back and that person will be
named as User. Only a single android application interfaces will be used for both parties
just. A database will be used to save communication history between both parties for
security purpose
Purpose
Lost2Find as its name suggests, is the idea of connecting the users on one social
platform to help the users to find their lost valuables. It is also difficult for the user to find
his lost valuable on social media platforms that we use today. This platform will
completely avoid the risk of any scammer because no scammer can get anything after
posting ad of anything but no one will contact him and at the end his ad will be turned
down. Lost2Find will allow the user to register themselves with the basic information
about their addresses and their email and phone number, later they can login to the app
through their username and password.
